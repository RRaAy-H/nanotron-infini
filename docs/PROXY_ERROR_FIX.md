# Proxy Error Fix for Infini-Llama Training

## Summary of Changes

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to fix proxy connection errors that occur when the training pipeline attempts to download models and tokenizers from Hugging Face. The solution adds a new "offline mode" feature that prevents all network access attempts.

## Problem

When training Infini-Llama models, the following error was occurring:

```
HTTPSConnectionPool(host='huggingface.co', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/models/gpt2/tree/main/additional_chat_templates?recursive=False&expand=False (Caused by ProxyError('Unable to connect to proxy', ConnectTimeoutError(...)))
```

This happened because:
1. The pipeline was trying to download GPT-2 tokenizer from Hugging Face
2. The environment had proxy issues preventing successful connection
3. PyTorch 2.x module structure changes made our previous fixes ineffective

## Solution Components

1. **New `--offline-mode` flag** in `flexible_training_workflow.sh`:
   - Enables a comprehensive set of offline features
   - Sets environment variables to prevent network access
   - Applies runtime patches to avoid download attempts

2. **Environment Variable Configuration**:
   - Sets `HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE=1`, `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1`, `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`
   - Disables telemetry, token usage, and other network features
   - Clears all proxy settings to prevent connection attempts

3. **Runtime Monkey Patching**:
   - Creates a Python wrapper script that patches modules at import time
   - Patches `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained()` to force `local_files_only=True`
   - Provides fallback tokenizer implementations when cached files aren't available

4. **Tokenizer Fallbacks**:
   - Tries to load locally cached tokenizers first
   - Falls back to basic tokenizer implementations if needed
   - Prevents training failures due to missing tokenizers

5. **Documentation**:
   - Added new `OFFLINE_MODE.md` document explaining the feature
   - Added troubleshooting guidance for network-related issues
   - Explained how to use the offline mode feature

## Files Changed

1. **`flexible_training_workflow.sh`**:
   - Added `--offline-mode` flag
   - Implemented comprehensive environment variable configuration
   - Created runtime patching system
   - Modified training command generation to use offline wrapper

2. **`run_direct_training.py`**:
   - Added `--offline-mode` flag
   - Added environment variable configuration
   - Added offline mode detection

3. **New Files Created**:
   - `fix_offline_trainer.py`: Patches the trainer module for offline mode
   - `OFFLINE_MODE.md`: Documentation for the offline mode feature

## Usage

To use the offline mode feature, add the `--offline-mode` flag when running the training workflow:

```bash
./flexible_training_workflow.sh --offline-mode --raw-data /path/to/data --config-file scripts/config/your_config.yaml
```

This will enable all the offline features and prevent any network access attempts during training.

## Testing

The solution was tested by:
1. Running the script with the `--offline-mode` flag
2. Verifying that no network access attempts were made
3. Confirming that the training pipeline runs successfully
4. Checking that the Adam optimizer weight_decay=None fix still works correctly

## Future Work

1. Consider caching commonly used tokenizers directly in the repository
2. Add explicit warnings when running in online mode in environments with known proxy issues
3. Create a pre-caching tool to download and cache all required files before training
